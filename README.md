# Recruitment-Pipeline-Analytics-Dashboard
## Project Description:
The recruitment process often faces inefficiencies in defining constraints, optimizing sourcing strategies, and evaluating candidate fit. These issues can lead to hiring delays, ineffective talent acquisition methods, and misaligned hiring choices. Furthermore, the lack of real-time insights and concerns over data integrity further hinder decision-making.

To overcome these challenges, the Recruitment Pipeline Analytics Dashboard integrates Blockchain Technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof hiring data. This system enhances recruitment efficiency by reducing time-to-hire, improving candidate quality, and providing interactive analytics, scenario modeling, and real-time alerts for better decision-making.
